# Senior Thesis Code
This repository contains the code associated with my Princeton Senior Thesis, "Computational Analysis of Alleged Homeric Texts."

The structure is as follows:
- The graphResults folder contains the most up-to-date result output; I don't ignore it for now because I want my results backed up.
- The greekAnalysisTools folder contains our main tools
- The scanData folder contains ground-truth scan data for the first 100 lines of the *Iliad*, *Odyssey*, and Callimachus' *Hymns*, as well as the results of the Vilnius scanner on book 1 of the *Iliad*. These resources are used for evaluation of our scanning tools.
- The supplementaryDictionaries folder contains supplements to the dictionary automatically extracted by the dictionary processor.
